<p>Feedback is important for artists to build a reputation. But it's also an invaluable asset for prospective buyers. As an existing customer, you make it possible for the artist you just commissioned to gain new clients and their future clients to make better purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>When choosing what feedback to give, just consider if you would recommend this artist to a friend of yours. Always try to keep reviews focused on the product you received as opposed what the artist was offering when they were pitching the commission. Did your piece end up being of similar quality to what they promised? Did it fulfill the expectations?</p>
