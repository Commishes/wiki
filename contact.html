<h2>How can I help to make commishes happen</h2>
<p>There's a lot of things you can do. We don't need any financial support to make the page happen but there are many things we could really use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Feedback and editing</strong></h3>
<p>Read through the pages of this wiki and send us an email with comments about what could make commishes an even better place to be on the net. We are really welcoming of sugggestions on how to improve the site over and over.</p>
<p>If you can add more than just quick comments, feel like fixing typos and wanna keep this wiki up to date then apply to be an editor.</p>

<h3><strong>Sharing</strong></h3>
<p>Yes! You may not be able to help us directly, but may know someone who does. Maybe you even know someone who knows someone who can help. You're helping by telling your friends that we need help.</p>
