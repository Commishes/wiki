<p>You are allowed to report every auction if you think it is justified.</p>
<p>To help us handle a report as fast as possible, please add all the information you can provide. For example, original source for stolen content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>If you want to report content, a user or suspicious activities</h1>
<p>It's most effectively to simply place the report directly on the auction. You can find the link to report an auction below the bid list. <i>Sometimes, the link is blocked by an add blocker or not visible on the mobile version. Please add an exception to your add blocker or change to desktop mode on your phone/tablet then.</i></p>
<p>When you can't place the report on an auction directly, you can contact us on several ways. Check <a href="/contact">contact</a> for more information. Please always state your username when contacting support and provide as many information as you can. Links are prefered over screenshots due to fast accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reporting content</h2>
<h3>stolen artwork</h3>
<p>We try to make it as easy as possible to report stolen artwork, and we always appreciate you take the time to bring issues to our attention. You can click on "report" on an auction itself and select the "Stolen artwork" option, or you can send an email (addresses are on <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/home/help">our help page</a>)</p>
<p>Here are a few things you can do to make it easier for the moderator reviewing the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be concise. We receive a lot of tickets every day and we do our best to review them as thoroughly as possible, but making it short makes it easier for us.</li>
  <li>Provide evidence. When you report something, a moderator has to review the art. They may not be familiar with the original artist and may have a hard time verifying your claims. Good evidence makes it easy and fast to resolve the issue.</li>
  <li>Be kind and patient. We review reports almost daily, often multiple times a day, but we're just humans. And remember, we're here to help you, we don't want thieves either.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>illegal content</h3>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to reach out to us and make sure that Commishes is a place for people to safely express themselves. And we're sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant experience. We're here to help and assist. We take illegal content seriously and do our best to remove it as soon as possible to avoid potential damage for other users.</p>
<p>To best report our content, please find our email address on our <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/home/help">Help page</a>. In order for our staff to best assess the situation, please include the subject line <strong>Abuse complaint:</strong>, followed by the appropriate category from the list below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Content inciting violence</li>
  <li>Grooming (making advances towards minors)</li>
  <li>Forbidden or illegal content</li>
  <li>Sexual photography and video recordings</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very serious path to go and it should not be taken lightly. Commishes removes only content that is considered criminal and is required to forward information about users involved to the authorities. Evidence you provide will be brought forward to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>As per protocol, you will receive a resolution within, at most, two working days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>If you have received a report.</h1>
<p>Any auction can receive a report out of one of 4 categories:</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong>, <strong>Untagged adult content</strong>, <strong>Illegal content</strong> and <strong>Fraudulent content/ Stolen art</strong>.</p>
<p>For which reason the report was made is shown directly on the auctions report site. There you can also see if a report is still open (#Pending) or already closed (#Resolved)</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the reason for the report you can click on ‚More…‘ to see if the user that placed the report also left a note.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about why you received an report, please take a look at our rules and see if you have missed something. Reports are checked manually by staff members and if the rule violation still applies it can lead to consequences, like account suspensions and canceled auctions.</p>
<p><i>Please always have in mind that reports are made by users, therefore we have no influence if an auction gets reported or not. If you're sure that a report is false, you can ignore it. Our moderators will review the report and mark it as resolved as soon as possible. It's not necessary to contact support about wrong reports.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Untagged adult content</strong></h3>
<p>If your auction was reported for untagged adult content, please correct that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://wiki.commishes.com/en/content_rating"><u>content rating guidelines</u></a> on our wiki.</p>
<p>Please check if the report is already marked as <strong>Resolved</strong> and do not send a message if your auction is tagged correctly. It's possible that we've already done that or that it was a false report.</p>
<p>If it was a false report, please remember that reports are made by users and that we have no influence on whether an auction is reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't delete auctions because of untagged adult content, unless your account gets suspended for over a week. This only happens after multiple offenses. If you can't find your auction, it's most likely due to you not being able to log in or because your <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/settings/display/"><u>display settings</u></a> are not set to allow adult content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Fraudulent content / Stolen art</strong></h3>
<p>If your auction was reported for Fraudulent content / Stolen art and you think it is unjustified, please reach out to us and send us proof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your auction include a base? Please check our <a href="http://wiki.commishes.com/en/base"><u>base specific rules</u></a> on our wiki. If you missed some of the required information, please make sure to add it. This could be a link to the original creator or their guidelines.</p>
<p>Auctions that are offering a base and missing appropriate attribution will be deleted.</p>
<p>If the report was spam, because it included no relevant information or was completely unrelated, you can safely ignore it. An administrator will close it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please remember that reports are made by users and that we have no influence on whether an auction is reported.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Stolen artwork</h4>
<p>At Commishes we consider stolen artwork to be any piece of artwork that was not original or properly attributed. When uploading images, animations and video you must respect the creator's copyright or be the content creator yourself. Do not upload content you do not own, your content will be removed and your account permanently suspended.</p>
<p>Traced artwork is not accepted on Commishes, unless the original creator explicitly allows you to trace it. You will be required to provide proof <strong>before</strong> you get reported and suspended. For this please refer to the <a href="http://wiki.commishes.com/en/base">special rules for bases</a> - your auction will otherwise be cancelled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Other</strong></h3>
<p>If your auction is reported for other reasons, please check the message in the report.</p>
<p>If the report is about <strong>missing base information</strong>, check the <a href="https://commishes.crunch.help/my-auction-got-reported/fraudulent-content-stolen-art"><u>Fraudulent content / Stolen Artwork section</u></a> for more information.</p>
<p>If your offering the&nbsp;same<strong>&nbsp;adoptable multiple </strong>times, please delete the redundant auctions. You can only have one auction for an adoptable running at the same time.</p>
<p>If you've set your <strong>starting bid </strong>lower than the minimum of what you are willing to work for or are reported for <strong>false bids</strong>, delete the auction.&nbsp;<br>Feel free to start it anew with the correct starting bid and without placing false bids again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Illegal content</strong></h3>
<p>Please check our wiki to see which <a href="http://wiki.commishes.com/en/reporting#guidelines-for-reporting-illegal-content"><u>content is not acceptable</u></a> on Commishes.</p>
<p>If the report was spam, because it included no relevant information or was completely unrelated, you can safely ignore it. An administrator will close it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please remember that reports are made by users and that we have no influence on whether an auction is reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Resolved reports</h1>
<p>All reports that are filed, are kept around for later reference by staff. If you receive a report, the report will be associated with your auction <strong>indefinitely</strong>. This is not bad, we often keep reports around for a variety of reasons, including stopping bad actors from fraudulently abusing the report system.</p>
<p>When your auction has a report (or several) that are marked as <mark class="marker-green">#resolved</mark> with a green text, it means that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Another user filed a report on the auction.</li>
  <li>A member of staff reviewed the auction and determined that your auction does not violate any rules.</li>
  <li>Your account is in good standing.</li>
  <li>You don't need to worry, your account is not at risk of getting banned or any other consequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, a resolved report is something good for you. It means that whatever the report is accusing you was deemed incorrect by Commishes staff. For example, if a report accuses you of art theft, but the report is resolved (and you haven't been warned or suspended for it), it means that the report was considered inaccurate and your auction is fine.</p>
