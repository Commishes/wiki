<h1>Shop safely</h1>
<p>Here we'll have a few things you should pay attention to, that we find suspicious and have made negative experience with. If you find yourself in a situation like any of these, be careful and feel free to report it.</p>
<p><strong>Auction is marked as Stolen Content: </strong>If an auction is marked as stolen content, do not send payment under any circumstances before an admin reviewed the situation. When the warning disappears, we closed the report and didn't find any evidence of Art Theft. We'll leave a note in the CRM if the reported user was banned.</p>
<p><strong>Price negotiation: </strong>here are some situations that occur often, but are not acceptable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its against PayPal's TOS to have a customer pay transfer fees. When the artist insists that you have to pay for the fees, you are allowed to back out of the commission and report them.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not pay as friends &amp; family!</strong> You won't have customer protection then. When the artist insists, please report to support.</li>
  <li>Charging you more <strong>after</strong> the commission is done is not allowed. Negotiating should take place before someone starts working or pays.</li>
  <li>Bribing you to buy or pay more, by telling you about personal problems. Begging behavior is not ok.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not responding: </strong>If you tried to contact the seller multiple times about the progress of your commission, and they are still not responding. We consider a time frame of a week as appropriate to respond since everyone can have a busy week.</p>
<p><strong>Making excuses </strong>or telling you about personal issues over and over again instead of showing any progress of your commission.</p>
<p><strong>Running a lot of auctions at the same time or starting new auctions. </strong>When an artist keeps creating new auctions while you're still waiting and won't send you any progress on your commission when asked to.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in any of these situations, please <a href="http://wiki.commishes.com/en/contact">consult support</a>.</p>
