<h1>Content Rating</h1>
<p>Across the Commishes sites we use three different content rating levels to allow users to filter whether they wish to see only family friendly content or whether they wish to have access to all the submissions (including those containing sexual content or gore). These ratings are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.commishes.com/en/content_rating#safe">Safe</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.commishes.com/en/content_rating#questionable-suggestive">Questionable / Suggestive</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.commishes.com/en/content_rating#explicit">Explicit</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.commishes.com/en/content_rating#shock">Shock&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, we accept all types of content as long as you select the appropriate category for the content. Not every content is easy to determine, so please use your common sense while choosing a category for your content. If you still have questions, please find help in our discord, Telegram group or send an E-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Safe</h2>
<p>Safe auctions are considered entirely kid friendly. This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No genitals</strong>. This includes feral animal sheaths, comical “X” anuses, and female nipples.</li>
  <li><strong>No outlines of genitals</strong>, even vaguely. Including through clothes.</li>
  <li><strong>No implication or indication of sex</strong> having had happened, happening, or going to happen.</li>
  <li><strong>No vulgar language.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>No blood or horror</strong>-themed images designed to be creepy or scare users.</li>
  <li><strong>Main camera focus must not be on a traditionally erotic section</strong> of the body, even if fully clothed.</li>
  <li><strong>No obvious fetishes of any kind</strong>, sexual or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Questionable / Suggestive</h2>
<p>Questionable pics are pictures designed to be erotic, suggestive or edgy, without going full porn. This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Nudity</strong> is fine so long as no reproductive genitals or anuses are seen.</li>
  <li><strong>Large breasts or butts</strong> are fine if not being used/touched sexually.</li>
  <li><strong>Comical genitals</strong> such as bathroom stall drawings of penises or “X” anuses, which are not erotic.</li>
  <li><strong>Implied sex</strong> through dialogue or facial expression only.</li>
  <li><strong>Suggestive underwear</strong> (this includes tight underwear and bikinis)</li>
  <li><strong>Artistic Bondage/Shibari</strong>, as long as no genitals are visible.</li>
  <li><strong>Candy gore</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Nude characters</strong> who are ‘conveniently censored’ such as a tree branch blocking their genitals.<i> Please remember if you offer an ‘uncensored’ version that it counts as explicit.</i></li>
  <li><strong>Recreational drug use</strong> such as alcohol or marijuana.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Explicit</h2>
<p>Hardcore porn that a majority of adults would not find gratuitous and censored previews of the artwork. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exposed female nipples</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bulges, camel toes, latex, and other tight fitting clothing</strong> that show the shape of the genitals below.</li>
  <li><strong>Any visible reproductive genitals or anus</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Sex</strong>, including ‘x-ray’ of egg/sperm</li>
  <li><strong>Sexual fluids</strong> <i>(this also applies to trivializing terms like "yoghurt" or "marmelade")</i></li>
  <li><strong>Erotic groping or rubbing</strong> (such as foreplay), <strong>masturbation</strong>, the use of <strong>toys</strong> which are designed to deliver sexual pleasure and <strong>Ahegao</strong> expressions</li>
  <li><strong>Fetishes involving sexual contact</strong>. (petplay, bdsm, tentacles, vore ... )</li>
  <li><strong>Terms that refer to anything sexual</strong>, including ahegao, MILF, trap, futa..</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Offering NSFW art or nude/futa versions, wether in the picture or in the description, also requires explicit tagging.</strong></p>
<p>Any picture depicting sexual content or that has genitals (including female nipples) on it, is considered explicit. <strong>You may not</strong> do any of the following to include your picture in the questionable or safe categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Censor the genitals with smileys, stickers or subway. You can do so, but you still have to tag your picture as explicit.</li>
  <li>Add clothing that allows the viewer to see the shape of the genitals below it. This refers to extremely tight leggings and latex clothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to tag this content may be punished with a suspension (ranging from a few hours to a few days) and the termination of your auction (if your suspension was to last for longer than the auction). Accounts created with the object of evading a suspension will be immediately and permanently terminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Shock</h2>
<p>Any image that is far outside of what is considered normal, but not disallowed by the site rules in <i>1.4 Indecent or illegal content. </i>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gore, blood, death, digestion, torture.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Wounds that are inflicted by a weapon.&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Actual organs and bones</strong> (Such as intestines, lungs, anatomically correct heart)</li>
  <li><strong>Anything the average person would consider ‘gross’</strong> such as scat, watersports, filth, farts, poor hygiene, and diapers.</li>
  <li><strong>Cub and non-human characters that appear or are implied to be younger than 18</strong>. Please remember human-like characters under 18 are not allowed per <i>1.4 Indecent or illegal content.</i></li>
  <li><strong>Bestiality</strong>, which on this site is currently defined as ‘sexual acts involving a non-sentient creature.’</li>
  <li><strong>Rape</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Non-recreational drug use.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Unaccepted content</h1>
<p>Please note that, while we encourage users to post whatever they like the following content cannot be accepted on the site:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Child pornography</strong></li>

<h2>Imageguide</h2>
<p>since we are asked very often about how to tag auctions correctly we'll try to explain a few things more detailed here.</p>
<h3><strong>female breasts</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boobchart.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>safe:</strong> definitely female, but no details shown. Functional bras are allowed.</li>
  <li><strong>questionable:</strong> as soon as it is no longer just about the character but about the gender, an auction must be labeled as questionable. That includes lingerie thats not only functional or underwear that shows more of the breasts than necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>explicit:</strong> as soon as the picture shows nipples it has to be tagged explicit. It doesn't matter if you just imply them with colors or if you can only see parts of the areola. Also, censoring is no excuse to tag your auction not explicit and therefore is unnecessary if you label your auction correctly.</li>
</ul>
