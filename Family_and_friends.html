<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Family and friends is used to scam dozens of users every month. When you pay using Family and friends, neither Commishes nor Paypal can help you with getting your money back.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The family and friends mode on Paypal is intended to send money to friends and relatives and does <strong>not offer payment protection</strong>. It is impossible to open a dispute a family and friends payment and you cannot report the recipient of the payment for scamming you. If you pay for a commission using Family and friends and do not receive art in return you've lost the money.</p>
<p>If an artist requires you to use family and friends please <a href="/contact">report them</a> immediately. <i>Do not interact with the artist at all</i>.</p>
<p>Also, refer to the <a href="/watch_out">safe buying guidelines</a> that will help you protect yourself against other bad practices.</p>
<h1>Why report artists who ask for Family and friends?</h1>
<p>First of all, you're doing the community a service. Malicious users usually attempt to contact dozens of potential victims at once. You're probably not the only person being involved in a scam, and reporting them to avoid them from involving other users will not only protect you but also protect others who may not be paying attention.</p>
<p>By reducing the attack surface of these scams you contribute to making them less appealing to scammers. If a scammer manages to scam a few users with a new account they will likely try again. If you report them right away, their scam will be less effective and they will be discouraged.</p>
<p>Also, you protect yourself. <strong>Paying using Goods and services provides you with payment protection from Paypal. </strong>You should not give up this privilege, under no circumstance.</p>
<h1>Common excuses used to scam you</h1>
<p>Scammers are crafty, they will attempt to make up reasons why they need you to pay using Family and friends. First of all, <strong>no reason is valid</strong>. But here are a few common ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Paypal will hold onto the funds if the payment is sent with goods and services</strong>. The scammer will claim to have emergency bills, like a vet or a sick relative. Paypal will only hold onto funds if they think that the account is fraudulent and expect the payment to be disputed. If the other person is not willing to wait for Paypal to clear the payment, you should not be willing to give them your money.</li>
  <li><strong>Paypal will take a cut from the payment</strong>. We all understand that it sucks to pay Paypal a cut, especially when they amount is small. This is cost of business. You're risking to lose all your money and get scammed when you send with family and friends. So it's either <i>7% (worst case) + 35ct</i> for the artist or your ability to protect yourself, you shouldn't give up the latter.</li>
</ul>
<h1>I paid using Family and friends</h1>
<p>Sorry. There's no way to put it mildly. There's nothing you, Commishes or Paypal can do about this. You're out of your money.</p>
<h1>What about Patreon? Or Boosty? Or any other?</h1>
<p>Patreon, Boosty, GoFundMe, Ko-Fi and similar services are not payment providers. They are tip jars. Sending money using any of these services is permanent and irreversible, just like <i>Paypal Family and friends</i>. <strong>When sending money with Boosty or Patreon you are sending it as a gift</strong>. You cannot undo the payment and rely on the other party to refund you if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Due to the recent conflict in Ukraine, many Russian artists have been driven off of Paypal and some have been forced to use Boosty. While this is true, it does not make the services inherently safe. <strong>Be careful</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some common red flags to detect scams when using tip jars. These are common to most auctions, but you should be extra careful when using these services.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user has a <strong>New member</strong> flag.</li>
  <li>The auction in question is an adoptable. Or you are required to pay before sketches.</li>
  <li>You are contacted as the runner up. The artist will claim the previous person did not pay.</li>
  <li>The user is from a country that offers safe payments like Paypal but they opt for Boosty/Patreon regardless.</li>
  <li>The seller will try to push you towards paying quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't feel confident, reach out to a moderator or ask on the support channel on our discord. Do not let a seller rush you into sending money when using these services. Legitimate artists won't feel threatened if you ask a moderator for help.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>. Tip jar payments are final. You cannot dispute them using Paypal or your bank, and Commishes cannot help you. If you got scammed or were sold a stolen adoptable we're unable to help you. All we can do is warn you ahead of time!</p>
