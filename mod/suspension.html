<h1><strong>general informations</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A suspension is made to give you some time to refresh your knowledge of our rules.</p>
<p>The duration of suspensions will increase for each following offense. <strong>If your account is suspended for more than a week, running auctions are canceled</strong>.</p>
<p>Suspensions for art theft&nbsp; and traced artwork are permanent. When your account is banned permanently, no timeframe is added to the suspension text.</p>
<p>We do our best to make sure that nobody gets banned without doing proper due diligence. If your account was suspended for art theft or traced artwork and it was a mistake, please <a href="https://help.commishes.com/account/v2/knowledge-base/articles/16"><u>reach out to us</u></a>, include your account name and add proof, that you are the original artist.</p>
