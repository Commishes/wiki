<h1>YCH Bidding</h1>
<p>Once your auction is ready, you can start receiving bid on your auction! Offering auctions and bidding on auctions on YCH is binding.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Users</strong>: When you bid on an auction you do commit to buying the auction for the indicated price, this is not voided by being overbid. If your bid results to be a runner up you're obligated to buy it.</li>
  <li><strong>Artists</strong>: Offering an auction for sale obligates to finish it according to the information provided.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Retracting bids</h2>
<p>You cannot retract a bid on YCH.Commishes. The system does not allow it, it's not a missing feature and it's not going to be added. If you bid on an auction and want your bid removed please contact the administration or the artist to have it removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If your bid was a prank bid (some friend of you added your email). Please contact administration and your bid will be removed.
  &nbsp; Please note that your email will be permanently banned from the system and you will no longer be able to bid on any auction hosted on the site
</p>
<p>If you still wish to have your bid removed and the bid was not spam, please contact the artist hosting the auction or post a comment on their auction. If comments are disabled, please contact administration and we'll be happy to assist you in reaching out to the user.</p>
<h2>Removing bids</h2>
<p>An artist can at any point remove a bid. If they do so, your bid is voided and you're no longer obligated to buy the auction. This can happen at any point, even after the auction ended. You can appeal the artist's decision to an administrator by contacting the administration.</p>
<p>An artist may remove your bid if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your bid did violate their ToS (these must be linked in the auction's description)</li>
  <li>Your bid was spam</li>
  <li>You requested removal of your bid</li>
  <li>The product you request from them after the auction was ended does violate against active legislations</li>
  <li>The product you request is outside the scope of the auction's description</li>
  <li>The product you request is beyond the artist's scope of ability or comfort</li>
</ul>
